I have obtained customer surveys from customers who purchased insurance.  The insurance is about investment, part of it comes from bonds and remaining is FX.  You pay for the insurance and after several years, the money will be returned to customers with extra money.  The survey asks about experience with sales persons, or experience buying insurance through web, SMS and mails that have information about news (we send them through SMS and mails), account page experience that contains about customers insurance, experience with after care, experience with phone inquiry.  One of the survey asks about the overall satisfaction about our insurance they purchased.  As a data scientist, I want to build a machine learning model to predict the customer satisfaction.  What kind of features for the input data that could be useful for the prediction?  I can obtain anything about customers including demographic info, their age, account access history, survey info, or anything you like.  Any ideas how to build the input data?


ChatGPT:
Nice! Predicting customer satisfaction is a great use case for machine learning, especially since you have access to rich survey data and behavioral and demographic information. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how to think about building input features for your model to predict overall satisfaction.

ðŸŽ¯ Target Variable
Overall Satisfaction Score: This could be a Likert-scale value (e.g., 1â€“5 stars), NPS score (0â€“10), or a classification like "satisfied"/"unsatisfied" depending on how it's asked.

ðŸ§± Categories of Useful Features
1. Survey Response Features
Quantify customer feedback from different channels:

Satisfaction with salesperson interaction (e.g., 1â€“5 scale)

Satisfaction with web purchase experience

Satisfaction with SMS/mail communication

Satisfaction with account page usability

Satisfaction with aftercare service (e.g., claim handling, follow-ups)

Satisfaction with phone inquiries

Free-text responses: can extract sentiment or topics using NLP (TF-IDF, embeddings)

ðŸ’¡ Tip: If your survey includes free text answers, use NLP features such as:

Sentiment polarity

Key topic clusters (via topic modeling or BERT embeddings)

2. Demographic Info
This helps personalize the model:

Age

Gender

Location (region, urban/rural)

Occupation

Marital status

Income bracket (if available)

3. Behavioral Data
These can be strong predictors of satisfaction:

Number of logins to account page (per month, total, recency)

Frequency of opening SMS/email campaigns

Click-through rate from messages to the website

Number of contacts made with customer support

Time spent on web portal per visit

Device used (mobile vs desktop)

4. Insurance Product & Financial Info
These can influence satisfaction, especially with investment-based products:

Amount paid into the insurance

Investment split: % bonds vs % FX

Policy term (years)

Return performance (actual vs expected)

Claim events (e.g., tried to claim, how it went)

Tenure: how long theyâ€™ve held the insurance

Number of policies purchased

Premium payment frequency (monthly, yearly)

5. Temporal Features
Satisfaction can change over time:

Time since purchase (days, months)

Recency of last interaction with company

Seasonality (e.g., satisfaction may dip during tax season or economic downturns)

6. Derived Features
Combine raw features to create new insights:

Engagement score: weighted average of digital interactions

Support intensity: number of support interactions per year

Survey consistency: did their satisfaction with individual channels align with overall satisfaction?

ðŸ§  Modeling Approach
ðŸ“Š Suggested Models:
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) â€“ handles tabular data and nonlinear interactions well

Logistic Regression or RidgeClassifier â€“ if satisfaction is binary and you want interpretability

Neural Networks â€“ if you have large data, especially useful for text + tabular hybrid

ðŸ§ª Preprocessing Tips:
Normalize numerical features (e.g., age, logins)

One-hot encode or target encode categorical variables

Handle missing data (e.g., fill with "unknown", median, or build a missingness flag)

ðŸ§° Optional Add-Ons
SHAP values for explainability: see which features drive satisfaction

Clustering customers first, then build satisfaction models per cluster

Time-series features if satisfaction changes over time (e.g., using temporal behavior or interaction sequences)
