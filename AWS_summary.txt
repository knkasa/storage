

AWS Regions:
Each region has 3 availability zone & 1 or more discrete data centers.
Only outbound data transfer is charged between different AZ zone.
AWS edge location: good for caching files.
Region specific: Many SaaS, Lambda

AWS advantage:
massive economies, trade capital expense, stop guess capacity, speed, go global

AWS service:
EC2: billed per second, with a minimum charge of 60 seconds. IaaS not PasS.  Scale in & out.
EC2 user data: bootstrap data.
Software Development Kit(SDK): Uses programming language to connect API such as lambda. encrypting data. 
Spot instance discount:  90
Elastic Blockstore: one instance per zone.
AWS system manager: manage EC2.   Improve security without opening port. Uses ssh. 
AWS Elastic Benstalk: Easily deploy programs written by PHP, Java, ...
AWS CloudHSM: Hardware security encryption.
CloudFront: Connect web globaly.
AWS Health dashboard: show AWS service usage in AZ zone. Alerts when AWS service go down.
Manage all AWS service: SDK, CLI, AWS Console(account page).
Lambda: pricing is based on number of request & runtim.

AWS SaaS:
AWS polly: convert text to speech.
Amazon Transcribe: Speech to text analysis.
Amazon MQ: messaging service.
AWS Rekognition: Indentify objects in Image.
AWS EMR: run Hadoop, Spark, ...
AWS wavelength: setup 5g.  
AWS local zone: low latency gaming.
AWS Macie: use machine learning to protect s3 data.
AWS Kendra: Search documents in data storage.
AWS x-ray:  debug performance

Recommended guidance:
AWS Trusted Advisor: Resource and cost guidance.
Instance Store: cashe.  provides high I/O performance.  Attached to hardware.
AWS Budgets: Set alert when cost exceeds limit.
Compute optimizer: optimize resource on EC2, EBS, lambda.. Note it's different from cost explorer. 
Cost explorer: Estimates on resource usage, and cost prediction.  (Usage Report is more detailed)
Optimize cost: EC2, dynamoDB, RDS (not s3, Lambda)
AWS Config: keep history of cofig changes.
AWS CloudFormation: Json, Yaml file to manage 3rd party resource.
Cloud Trails: logs any API connection.  encrypted by default. Compliance, governance, risk.
Cloud Watch: logs resource usage. Can log on-premise too.  
CloudFoundation: Provide gaide for deployment.
AWS organization: make multiple acounts into one bill.
AWS EventBridge: log

Security:
customer managed key: encrypting key for customer side.
Security group: allow rules(return) only. However, it can accept inbound & outbound.    
AWS shield standard: enable by default for free.  Protection from DDOS. Shield advance has 7 layer protection.
GuardDuty: detect malicious attack/activities.
Amazon Inspector: Automate security(valunerbility) assesment.  Monitor DDOS attack.
AWS shield : Firewall.  Protect against DDos for ELB, EC2, Route55, AWS acceleration. Standard is for free.
AWS Web Firewall: 7 layer protection.
Route53: improves latency. Protect ddos.
ACL: security at subnet level. security group is at instance level. Configure s3 & VPC. Automatically allow return traffic. Rule in increasing order whether to allow traffic.
Penetration test: Security assessment test.
Route53: sends signals when failover, slow latency, simple/weighted traffic, ...
Subnet: Part of your VPC, available only one region.

Gateway:
VPC endpoint connection:  used to privately connect S3 & DynamoDB (Database & storage)
Gateway type: Tape, File, Volume.
VPN: Allow to connect between on-premise & AWS.
NAT gateway: use internet access privately in subnet level.
Storage gateway: Used for Hybrid environment fo storage(s3).
Transit gateway: Connects between on-premise & AWS.
Site-to-site gateway: Also connect between on-premise & AWS. Smaller scale thant Transit gateway. Uses virtual gateway, customer gateway. 

Database:
AWS Glue: ETL
RDS: horizontal scalability. (read replica=reduce scalability, not avilability)
AWS Neptune: graph storage.
AWS Athena: run SQL on s3.
Aurora=database, Redshift=data warehouse.
s3: Used with cloudFront to improve static Web efficiency. Auto encryption.
s3 global acceleration: used for data transfer.
DynmoDB: non-sql DB, highly available

Shared responsibility:
Configuration management:  Share responsibility between customer and AWS.
Underlying OS patch:  AWS team will do it automatically. 

Pillar:
Incorrect reliability pillar: fault tolerance is scale up.
Reliablility pillar: CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS config,

Data Transfer:
AWS snowball: transfer large volume of files. Allow on-premise.
Elastic File system(EFS): You pay each time you read/write.

IAM:
IAM plog: effect, action, policy.

Extra:
AWS pin-point: Sends mails, service advice for marketers.
CAF: CTO & Engineer.  Agile method & organize your teams.  business, people, governance, platform, security, operations.
AWS consulting partner: consultation regarding global business.  Concierge support is for more account & technical support.
AWS artifact: AWS compliance & pament report.
AWS partner Network(APN): give solution to your needs. Organized by non-AWS.
Contextual guidance: Business support or above.
AWS acceptable use polity: prohibits use of web.
TAM: Only AWS enterprise support provide TAM.
Reserved Instance: saves 72%.
AWS knowledge center: Forum.
Tab: must be unique. Must activate before they appear in cost explorer.
